# Google Chrome QR Code Scanner

Scans all QR codes on a website or PDF opened in Chrome. Utilizes [nimiq/qr-scanner](https://github.com/nimiq/qr-scanner) to read the QR code.

# Installation

Plan to make it available on the Chrome Web Store soon.

In the mean time, you can simply download it as a ZIP file, extract it, and load it as an unpacked extension.
